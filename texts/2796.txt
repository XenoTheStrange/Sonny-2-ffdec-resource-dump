Congratulations! You've beaten the game. So what now? If you haven't already, I recommend you to try the game on 'Heroic' difficulty, the way that it was designed to be played! Or perhaps pitch your own character against a friend's, using the 'PvP Arena' option. Visit www.ArmorGames.com for more games (including the first chapter of Sonny) and check for updates, in case we add some new Zones for you to play in. Seeya next time!
